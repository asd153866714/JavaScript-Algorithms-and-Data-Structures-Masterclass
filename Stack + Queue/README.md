# Stack
* LILO (Last In Last Out)

## Use of Stack
* Managing function invocations
* Undo / Redo (PhotoShop)
* Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack!

## Implementation
* Array
* Linked List

## Push
* The function should accept a value
* Create a new node with that value
* If there are no nodes in the stack, set the first and last property to be the newly created node 
* If there is at least one node, create a variable that stores the current first property on the stack
* Reset the first property to be the newly created node
* Set the next property on the node to be the previously created variable
* Increment the size of the stack by 1

## Pop
* If there are no nodes in the stack, return null
* Create a temporary variable to store the first property on the stack
* If there is only 1 node, set the first and last property to be null
* If there is more than one node, set the first property to be the next property on the current first
* Decrement the size by 1
* Return the value of the node removed

## Big O of Stack
* insert - O(1)
* remove - O(1)
* search - O(n)
* access - O(n)

# Queue
* FIFO (First In First Out)

## Use of Queue
* Online game waiting to join
* Background tasks
* Uploading resources
* Printing / Task processing

## Implementation
* Array
* Linked List

## Enqueue
* This function accepts some value
* Create a new node using that value passed to the function
* If there are no nodes in the queue, set this node to be the first and last property of the queue

Otherwise, set the next property on the current last to be that node, and then set the last property of the queue to be that node
* Increment the size of the queue by 1

## Dequeue
* If there is no first property, just return null
* Store the first property in a variable
* See if the first is the same as the last (check if there is only 1 node). If so, set the first and last to be null
* If there is more than 1 node, set the first property to be the next property of first 
* Decrement the size by 1
* Return the value of the node dequeued

## Big O of Queue
* insert - O(1)
* remove - O(1)
* search - O(n)
* access - O(n)

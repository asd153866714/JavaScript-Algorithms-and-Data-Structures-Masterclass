# Binary Heaps

## What Is A Binary Heap?
* **Very** similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules!
* In a **MaxBinaryHeap**, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. 
* In a **MinBinaryHeap**, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

---

# Max Binary Heap
* Each parent has at most two child nodes
* The value of each parent node is **always** greater than its child nodes
* In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
* A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

## Why do we know this
* Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are very commonly used data structures

* They are also used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms

## Presenting Heap
* Tree
* List / Array (easy way)

## Sorting Heap (Array)
* Use parent node to find children

* Use children node to find parent

## Insert
* Push the value into the values property on the heap
* Bubble Up:
    * Create a variable called index which is the length of the values property - 1
    * Create a variable called parentIndex which is the floor of (index-1)/2
    * Keep looping as long as the values element at the parentIndex is less than the values element at the child index
        * Swap the value of the values element at the parentIndex with the value of the element property at the child index
        * Set the index to be the parentIndex, and start over!

## Removing (also called extractMax)
* Swap the first value in the values property with the last one
* Pop from the values property, so you can return the value at the end.
* Have the new root **sink down** to the correct spot...â€‹
    * Your parent index starts at 0 (the root)
    * Find the index of the left child: 2 * index + 1 (make sure its not out of bounds)
    * Find the index of the right child: 2*index + 2 (make sure its not out of bounds)
    * If the left or right child is greater than the element...swap. If both left and right children are larger, swap * with the largest child.
    * The child index you swapped to now becomes the new parent index.  
    * Keep looping and swapping until neither child is larger than the element.
    * Return the old root!
### Sink Down
* The procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in a min-heap) and restoring the properties is called down-heap

* Also known as bubble-down, percolate-down, sift-down, trickle down, heapify-down, cascade-down, and extract-min/max

# Priority Queue
* A data structure where each element has a **priority**. 
* Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.

## implemmentation
* Write a **Min Binary Heap** - lower number means higher priority.
* Each Node has a val and a priority.  Use the priority to build the heap.
* **Enqueue** method accepts a value and priority, makes a new node, and puts it in the right spot based off of its priority.
* **Dequeue** method removes root element, returns it, and rearranges heap using priority.

## Big O of Priority Queue
* Insertion - O(log N)
* Removal - O(log N)
* Search - O(N)

# Recap
* Binary Heaps are very useful data structures for **sorting**, and implementing other data structures like **priority queues**

* Binary Heaps are either **MaxBinaryHeaps** or **MinBinaryHeaps** with parents either being smaller or larger than their children

* With just a little bit of math, we can represent heaps using arrays!

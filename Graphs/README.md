# Graph

## Definitions
* Nodes + Connections

## Uses for Graphs
* Social Networks
* Location / Mapping
* Routing Algorithms
* Visual Hierarchy
* File System Optimizations
* EVERYWHERE!

#### Recommendations
* "People also watched"
* "You might also like..."
* "People you might know"
* "Frequently bought with"

## Essential Graph Terms
* Vertex - a node

* Edge - connection between nodes

* Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices

* Directed/Undirected - directions assigned to distanced between vertices

## Sorting Graph

* Adjacency Matrix
    * Every time you add a new vertex, you have to add a new row and column.

* Adjacency List
    * Array (numeric)
    * Hash Table (string)

#### Difference

* Adjacency Matrix:
    * Takes up more space (in sparse graphs)
    * Slower to iterate over all edges
    * Faster to lookup specific edge 

* Adjacency List:
    * Can take up less space (in sparse graphs)
    * Faster to iterate over all edges
    * Can be slower to lookup specific edge

#### Why we use Adjacency List
Most data in the real-world tends to lend itself to sparser and/or larger graphs
